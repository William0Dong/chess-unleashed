A fade between two background images

An animation for the beginning of the page load, and then animations for buttons after the page loads.

How many wrappers I need to organize the function.

Finding a framework.

Webkit vs regular variations.

Using console.log to see what's causing null values in JS and why it's null (because its checking id during page load instead of after with the rest).

Why vertical/horizontal scroll isnt all the way in buttons.

Tried calling from a CDN but had to edit files locally so instead used NPM.\

Could not run script in JS, figured out how to import and the importance of putting node modules in project folder, and using different protocols (file vs HTTPS://)

Export still didnt work because line enabling exports didnt work;

/img/chesspieces/wikipedia/{piece}.png' calls from html file in pages instead of in dist. Had to figure out what the DOM meant when it checked images instead of img/chesspieces. Had to create own folder as the API didnt come with one.

// import { Chessboard } from '../scripts/node_modules/@chrisoakman/chessboardjs/dist/chessboard-1.0.0.js'; doesnt do anything because you dont need to use certain modules.

Stylesheet does the styling of the board for you.

Better to call jquery online.

OVERFLOW only covers bottom overflow. Dont use flex on everything because somethings you want to be able to zoom into to enlarge. Set height: 100%.

Tried to use flex: center with height:100% for .text class, but since .text didnt shrink and box did it centered based on the .text so got rid of it.

Set height to 0px to use as a line to align things, and set width to custom px for second row of header since less letters took up more space.

Needed to adjust padding since lines were arranged such that center made the second line closer to the bottom than first line closer to top.

Let images stay the same size to prevent myself from using z-index, since couldnt set z-index to be behind both bottom and top pictures due to the before property css.
