A fade between two background images

An animation for the beginning of the page load, and then animations for buttons after the page loads.

How many wrappers I need to organize the function.

Finding a framework.

Webkit vs regular variations.

Using console.log to see what's causing null values in JS and why it's null (because its checking id during page load instead of after with the rest).

Why vertical/horizontal scroll isnt all the way in buttons.
